# MovieSearch
A simple movie app that uses TvMaze API.
Written in Android with Kotlin in MVVM architecture.  
It has an initial animation on the welcome screen, and then we enter a search page.  
The search results can be found on the Results page.  
It uses Navigation Component, ViewModel, Retrofit, JSON, Glide, and Binding Adapters.  
The app's purpose is to quickly find movies based on name, and it is based on a simple search.  
Multiple functionalities may be added in the future: Save favorite movies, Call different api's to populate the details screen, and search cache.
